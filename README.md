# Introduction
No company wants to experience churn, but it is usually inevitable. Churn is the percentage of customers that stop using your business during a given time frame. Telco is a telecommunication company that provides both Phone and internet services. Telco company experienced a high rate of churned customers in the previous month. Before customer retention can be developed, all the relevant customer data are analyzed to determine what could have caused the high churn rate.

# About the dataset
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn. It contained 21 columns and 7043 rows. The columns contained;

•	Customer ID

•	Demographic informations about the customers – gender, society status(senior citizen) and if they have partners and dependents

•	Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

•	Customer account information – tenure, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

•	Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

# Summary of Findings
For the analysis I focused on three major sectors - finance (payment method), service (internet) and contract. After the dataset was analysis thoroughly, I found the following insights

•	Payment method – In as much as there are more customers on electronic check method most were churned in the previous month.

Further analysis revealed that most customers on month-to-month contract use electronic check as their payment method.

# Suggestions on customer retention program based on analysis

•Offer long-term contract

• Improve services

• Offer incentives – It could be those on month-to-month are students

• Have a solid and dedicated customer service team – This team will build a relationship between the customer and business, they will also forward, and followup on logged complains

• Request for feedback after complaints have been resolved

• Create video or voice tutorials on how to set up and resolve issues. This will reduce the call logs on the helpline.
